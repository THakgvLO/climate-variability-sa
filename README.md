# Climate Variability and Change in Pretoria (1964–2024)

This project presents a spatial and statistical assessment of long-term climate variability in Pretoria, South Africa, using historical temperature and rainfall data from 1964 to 2024. It forms part of a broader academic investigation into regional climate trends, urban heat dynamics, and environmental change.

## 🌍 Project Overview

- **Location:** Pretoria, South Africa
- **Period Covered:** 1964–2024
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Temperature anomalies and seasonal shifts
  - Rainfall variability and drought patterns
  - Urbanisation impacts on local climate
  - Data-driven interpretation of climate change signals

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Time series manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Graphical representation of trends
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis and documentation


## 📈 Key Findings

- Notable warming trend post-1990, with increased frequency of heat anomalies
- Rainfall variability linked to urban expansion and seasonal shifts
- Evidence of climate change signals consistent with global patterns
- Strong potential for replicability and further regional analysis

## 📌 Academic Context

This analysis was submitted as part of a major assignment for Environmental Science (Applied Climatology) coursework, receiving high marks for clarity, structure, and analytical depth. The report includes visualizations, anomaly detection, and recommendations for future research.
